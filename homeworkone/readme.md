## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are generally static, providing information to users without requiring much interaction, while web applications are dynamic and allow user interaction through forms or other inputs. Understanding the difference helps in determining the purpose and complexity of what is being built.

### VS Code & Extensions

VS Code is a versatile code editor that supports multiple programming languages and can be customized with extensions. Extensions enhance functionality, such as adding debugging tools or language-specific features, making development more efficient.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version control helps track changes in code, ensuring easy collaboration and the ability to revert to previous versions if needed. Git is the tool that manages version control locally, while GitHub serves as a cloud-based platform to store and share projects.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to format text for documentation, creating structured and readable files. Clear documentation is crucial in any project to help understand the codebase and its functionality.
